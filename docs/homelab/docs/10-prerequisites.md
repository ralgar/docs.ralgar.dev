# Prerequisites

If you want to deploy this project for yourself, there are some basic
 requirements that you'll need.

## Knowledge

This project is designed to be extremely easy to use, but that does **not**
 mean it is intended for beginners! We're using advanced concepts here, and
 it's expected that you will fork the project and continue development on
 your own.

You should have intermediate knowledge of the following technologies:

- Linux
- Git
- OpenStack or another cloud platform
- GitLab or another CI/CD platform
- Ansible
- Terraform
- Kubernetes

## Hardware

If you don't already have an OpenStack cloud to deploy on, then you'll need
 some suitable hardware.

</div>

This project is built and tested against an old Dell T420 tower server, which
 can be had for as little as $400. It's a capable and reliable machine, that
 avoids the significant investment of a rack-mounted setup. Perfect for almost
 any homelab!

### Minimum Specs

You can use any hardware you like, however, provided it meets the following
 minimum specs:

| CPU        | Memory    | Storage                       | Network      |
|------------|-----------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| 24 threads | 64 GB RAM | 1x 1 TB NVMe + 1x HDD array   | 2x 1 GbE NIC |

## Other Requirements

You'll also need the following:

- A GitLab account
- A Google account (for off-site backups)

## Initial Setup

### Dependencies

You'll need to install a few dependencies on your local system.

- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
  - [python-netaddr](https://pypi.org/project/netaddr)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/)

### Repository

1. Sign in to your GitLab account, and
   [fork](https://gitlab.com/ralgar/homelab/-/forks/new) this project's
   repository.

1. Clone your fork to your local system, and change directory into it.

   ```sh
   git clone https://gitlab.com/<your-namespace>/homelab.git
   cd homelab
   ```
